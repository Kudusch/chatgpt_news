<p>The distribution of domain counts (i.e.&nbsp;how often a site was referenced by ChatGPT) skews heavily right (20.63), with a few sites referenced often and many sites being referenced only once.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-domain-counts" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> shows how the 198 of 816 most referenced sites account for 90% of all linked domains and 122 of 1183 sites in the diverse condition. Around 40% of all referenced sites are referenced only once and around 70% are referenced no more than 5 times (see <a href="#fig-domain-counts-cat" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>).</p>
